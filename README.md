# technical-test
A basic level technical test for applicants for a QA position

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The technical test has one goal and one rule:

THE GOAL:
- Make all the unit tests in the 'TechnicalTestUnitTests' project pass

THE RULE:
- Achieve the goal by ONLY modifying (the code in) the 'TechnicalTestCore' project
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO GET THE TECHNICAL TEST ON YOUR LOCAL SYSTEM:
1. Either clone using Git
1.1 Install Git to your local system
1.1 Go to https://github.com/dynamiccredit-qa/technical-test
1.2 Click on the green-colored 'Clone or Download' button
1.3 Use the provided .git URL to clone the repository to your local system with
    the installed Git client
2. Or download
2.1 Go to https://github.com/dynamiccredit-qa/technical-test
2.2 Click on the green-colored 'Clone or Download' button
2.3 Click on the 'Download ZIP' button to download a copy of the solution

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO GET STARTED WITH THE TECHNICAL TEST
1. Install Visual Studio to your local system
2. Open the TechnicalTest.sln file with Visual Studio
3. Choose 'Build | Rebuild solution'
4. Open UnitTests.cs in the TechnicalTestUnitTests project
5. Rightclick in the opened UnitTests.cs window and click 'Run Tests'
6. If all went well this will make the unit tests run. The technical test consists
   of making these (failing) unit tests pass.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HANDING IN THE TEST RESULTS:
There are two ways to hand in the exercise:
1. Either commit your solution to the GitHub repository:
1.1 Create a new branch off master with your own name as branch name
1.2 Commit your solution to the technical test to your branch
1.3 Create a pull request to merge your branch to master
2. Or make a .zip or .7z of your solution and email it to your contact at the 
   office

P.S.
If you have applied for a QA position and have been asked to do this test, please
bear in mind:
We are aware that the technical skill of QA professionals varies greatly. The test
will be trivial for some and very hard for others. As such not being able to
complete the entire test doesn't mean your application won't be considered. We'd
just like to see how far you did get.
